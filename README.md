# General information

This project is a task after half a semester of programming course by [Ilya Dedinsky](https://github.com/ded32).
Project contains two programs: Assembler and Processor.

The Assembler receives an .asm file with instructions in my own assembly language. The result of his work is a .bin file with these instructions, translated into binary format.

The Processor receives the .bin file from the Assembler. The process then processes the content.
